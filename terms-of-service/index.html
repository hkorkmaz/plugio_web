    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 6, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By installing, accessing, or using the Plugio visualization plugin for Atlassian products (the "Plugin"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not install or use the Plugin.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of the Plugin</h2>
    <p>Plugio provides visualization gadgets — including gauge, counter, and progress bar widgets — for Atlassian product dashboards. The Plugin renders visual representations of data already available within your Atlassian instance. It does not collect, store, or transmit any data outside of your Atlassian environment.</p>

    <h2>3. License</h2>
    <p>Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Plugio grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Plugin in accordance with the Atlassian Marketplace terms and conditions. For full license terms, please see our <a href="/eula">End User License Agreement</a>.</p>

    <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Plugin only within an authorized Atlassian instance.</li>
      <li>Comply with all applicable Atlassian Marketplace policies and guidelines.</li>
      <li>Not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the Plugin.</li>
      <li>Not redistribute, sublicense, or resell the Plugin.</li>
      <li>Not use the Plugin for any unlawful purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Plugin, including all code, design, and documentation, is the intellectual property of Plugio. These Terms do not grant you any ownership rights to the Plugin. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by Plugio.</p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>THE PLUGIN IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. PLUGIO DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE PLUGIN WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PLUGIO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PLUGIN, EVEN IF PLUGIO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL PLUGIO'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE PLUGIN IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.</p>

    <h2>8. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Plugio and its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses arising out of or in connection with your use of the Plugin or your violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>9. Modifications to the Plugin and Terms</h2>
    <p>Plugio reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Plugin at any time without notice. We also reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Plugin after changes to the Terms constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>Plugio may terminate or suspend your access to the Plugin at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice. Upon termination, your right to use the Plugin ceases immediately.</p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable law, without regard to conflict of law principles.</p>

    <h2>12. Severability</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the remaining Terms remain in full force and effect.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
